# PIC18F46K80 Drivers
This is to be a collection of drivers for the PIC18F46K80 utilising Microchips XC8 compiler.

Its not perfect! Some drivers with source code are meant to be used as drivers, but those with simply .md files are more for a cookbook type example, like the interrupts and timers.

# Usage/Install
Ive been using it as a git submodule and then having the includes reference the specific files. It saves having to reinstall the drivers every time as Ive found them to be requiring a lot of modification!

# Questions/Comments/Abuse
All genuine Questions/Comments/Abuse would be greatly appreciated. I am by no means a software engineer and would like to learn. 

If you like/use the library, it would be great to see a little star, Cheers!
